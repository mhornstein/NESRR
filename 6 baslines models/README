The experimenter.py Script
==========================
The experimenter.py script takes the path to the dataset created in part 2a and a path to an output directory as inputs.
Than, the script classify each sentence in the dataset based on three different heuristics:
1. Entity Count: Count the number of entities in the sentence.
If the count surpasses a certain threshold, the classification will be 1; otherwise, it will be 0. All possible thresholds are tested.
2. Mask Distance: Measure the number of tokens between the two tokens containing the masked entities in the sentence.
If this distance exceeds a certain threshold, the classification will be 1; otherwise, it will be 0. All possible thresholds are tested.
3. Random Score: Assign a random value of 0 or 1 to each sentence. This score will serve as the sentence's classification.

How to run the script?
======================
In the command prompt, type: python experimenter.py <path to dataset> <name of result directory>

for example:
python experimenter.py ../data/data.csv results
or:
python experimenter.py ../data/dummy/dummy_data.csv results

Script output
=============
Progress will be shown on the console.
The result directory will be generated, and inside it, one will find the following:
1. `experiments_logs.csv`: stores each experiment's ID, its configuration, and some results, such as accuracy scores.
2. Directories numbered 1, 2, ... corresponding to the experiment_id. Each directory will contain a classification report containing all classification metrics.

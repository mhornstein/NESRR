The regressor.py Script
=======================
The regressor.py script is designed to train BERT for the purpose of performing regression.
Its goal is to predict the mutual information (MI) between two masked entities in a sentence.
To accomplish this task, the script makes use of the dataset generated in part 1.

How to run the script?
======================
All the explanations are available in the script's docstring.
To access this information via the command line, you can run the following command:
python regressor.py --h

Script output
=============
* The progress will be logged to the console.
* The "result" directory will be generated to store the results, which includes the following files:
- avg_train_loss.jpg: a plot illustrating the loss of the training set over the epochs.
- avg_val_loss.jpg: a plot illustrating the loss of the validation set over the epochs.
- epoch_time.jpg: a plot illustrating the duration of each epoch.
- results.csv: a CSV file containing the aforementioned information in a textual format.
- test_predictions_results.csv: a CSV file containing the test-predictions results. It also contains the masked sentences and the
                                information about the masked labels for better anlysis.
- test_report.txt: a text file containing the calculated loss for the test set.

More configurations
===================
* Batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs can be adjusted by updating the corresponding constants: BATCH_SIZE, LEARNING_RATE, and NUM_EPOCHS, respectively.
* You can modify the MI_TRANSFORMATION constant to apply a transformation to the MI score before training the network.
This transformation can be one of the following options: 'sqrt', 'ln', 'log10', or None (for no transformation).
* You can change the model type (for example, to bert-large-cased) by modifying the BERT_MODEL constant.
